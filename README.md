# day---5-project---Password-Generator

using the knowledge i gained in day 5 , i've created a " Password Generator project " , which asks user how many letters, symbols and numbers would you like to add in your Password and Generate's a "Random Password" using the user's input. ( do u want to create a strong password feel free to Try it...! ðŸ˜…)
